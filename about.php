        <div class="p-3 ">
        <p class="h4">One of them most urgent development challenges in Namibia over the past three decades
            is unemployment amongst qualified teachers. Hanghuwo (2019) reported that it is evident
            that more qualified teachers exist over the number of available positions to fill.
            To which the current Namibian Minister of Education, Arts and Culture; Hon. Anna Nghipondoka
            responded that the Ministry will only provide a total of 1600 teaching vacancies as of 2019,
            which merely amounts to a little over 60% of the number of qualified teachers that were produced in
            that year. “Amongst the total number of 2019 graduates, over 2000 students came from the faculty of
            education.” (Iikela.S,2020) The majority of which are still unemployed or between jobs.
            Tubaundula (2021) believes that the main issue is the lack of available jobs for the annual
            high influx of teachers. There are many instances where, when teachers finally see the vacancy, it is
            way past the due date. With this in mind it is safe to believe that it is vital for every teacher to have
            equal opportunities at accessing available vacancies on time at a centralized platform.</p>
